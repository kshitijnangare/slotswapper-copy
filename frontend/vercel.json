{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```
* **What this does:** It tells Vercel: "For any request that comes in (like `/login`, `/signup`, `/anything`), rewrite it to serve the `index.html` file." This lets your React app load and React Router to take control.

#### Step 3: Fix the Favicon (Optional, but Good)
The `favicon.ico 404` error is separate. Just make sure you have a file named `favicon.ico` inside your `frontend/public/` folder.

#### Step 4: Commit and Push Your Fix
Now, just add this one new file to GitHub.

1.  Open your terminal in the **root `slotswapper/` folder**.
2.  Run these commands:

    ```bash
    git add frontend/vercel.json
    git commit -m "fix: Add vercel.json rewrites for React Router SPA"
    git push
